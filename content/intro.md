Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning marathon run by students at the University of Warwick, UK. Now in its fifth year, it's the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. Our next event is WASD Summer, which will take place on the 14th and 15th of August 2021.

The event raises money for SpecialEffect, a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games.
